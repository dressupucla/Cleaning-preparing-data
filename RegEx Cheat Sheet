##Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet with examples for OpenRefine

Regular Expressions can be used in OpenRefine, as well as in other applications like Python and R, to manipulate data in a more fine-grained detail.


As a first example, here is an adapted example from https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Understanding-Regular-Expressions. 
Specifcally, consider the number as our datapoint of interest: -120.899. 

We can describe this number as:
  -It optionally starts with a sign (minus or plus)
  -Then it consists of a sequence of one or more digits
  -Then optionally if it has a decimal part, it contains a period, followed by one or more digits

In regular expressions, this data structure is written out as:
 [-+]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?
 
 The question mark ? denotes an optional character or group of characters. The period . needs to be escaped by preceding it with a backslash \. A digit is denoted as the range of character from 0 to 9.
